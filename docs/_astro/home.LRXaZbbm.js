BART is an open source tool developed by the Baseline Working Group to help test process owners enter their test results for Baseline Test Cases to determine how well they align to expected Baseline results.\r
\r
We encourage and welcome feedback and suggestions from the testing community! For user support, email the [ICT Baseline Working Group](mailto:ictbaseline@gsa.gov).\r
